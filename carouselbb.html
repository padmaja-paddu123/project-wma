  <h3>Famous Players And Rules in  Chess</h3>
  <h1> RULES OF CHESS</h1>
  
    <p>

        Checkmate the opponent's king, meaning the king is under attack and cannot escape capture.
        <br>
        <br>
        Gameplay Basics:
        
        1. Setup: The board consists of 64 squares, arranged 8x8.
        2. Pieces: Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
        3. Turns: Players alternate turns, with white moving first.
        <br>
        <br>
        Piece Movement:
        
        1. King: One square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
        2. Queen: Any number of squares in any direction (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
        3. Rook: Any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
        4. Bishop: Any number of squares diagonally.
        5. Knight: Two squares in one direction (horizontally or vertically), then one square in a perpendicular direction.
        6. Pawn: One square, but captures diagonally one square.
        <br>
        <br>
        
        Special Moves:
        
        1. Castling: King moves three squares towards a rook, swapping places.
        2. En Passant: Pawn captures opponent's pawn "en passant" if it moves two squares forward.
        3. Promotion: Pawn reaches opponent's end row, can promote to any piece.
        <br>
        <br>
        Check and Checkmate:
        
        1. Check: King under attack.
        2. Checkmate: King under attack, with no escape.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other Rules:
        
        1. Stalemate: No winner if:
            - King not in check.
            - No legal moves.
            - Same position three times.
        2. Draw: Agreement between players or insufficient material.
        3. Resignation: Player concedes.
        <br>
        <br>
        Common Rules:
        
        1. Touch-move rule: Player must move touched piece.
        2. 50-move rule: Draw if no capture or pawn move in 50 moves.
        3. Threefold repetition: Draw if same position occurs three times.
        <br>
        <br>
        Penalties:
        
        1. Loss of game
        2. Time penalty
        3. Warning for unsportsmanlike conduct
        <br>
        <br>
        Chess Variations:
        
        1. Blitz chess: Time-limited games.
        2. Rapid chess: Faster games.
        3. Correspondence chess: Long-distance games.
        <br>
        <br>
        Key Concepts:
        
        1. Opening: Early game strategy.
        2. Middlegame: Transition from opening to endgame.
        3. Endgame: Final stage, focusing on king safety.
        <br>
        <br>
        Chess Notation:
        
        1. Algebraic notation: Recording moves (e.g., e2-e4).
        2. Coordinate notation: Recording squares (e.g., e4).
        <br>
        <br>
        Understanding these rules provides a solid foundation for playing chess.
