  <h3>Famous Players And Rules in ludo</h3> <h1>RULES OF LUDO</h1>
    <p>
        <br>
        <br>
        Ludo, also known as Parcheesi, is a popular board game that's easy to learn and fun to play. Here are the basic rules:

        Number of Players:
        2-4 players can play Ludo.
        
        Objective:
        Be the first player to move all of your pieces (tokens) around the board and into the "Home" or "Safety" zone.
        <br>
        <br>
        Setup:
        
        1. Each player chooses a set of tokens (usually 4).
        2. Players place their tokens on the starting square.
        3. Determine who goes first by rolling a dice; the player with the highest number goes first.

        <br>
        <br>
        Gameplay:       

1. Roll the dice to determine how many squares to move.
2. Move one token the corresponding number of squares.
3. Tokens can only move clockwise.
4. If a player rolls a 6, they can move a token from the starting square to the first square.
<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Rules:

1. Safety Zones: Tokens are safe from capture in these zones.
2. Capture: If a player lands on a square occupied by an opponent's token, they capture that token and send it back to the starting square.
3. Blocking: Players can block opponents by placing two or more tokens on the same square.
4. Home Run: A player must roll the exact number to move a token into the Home zone.
5. Finish: The game ends when one player moves all their tokens into the Home zone.
<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
Special Rules:

1. Double Roll: Rolling doubles allows a player to move twice.
2. Six Roll: Rolling a 6 allows a player to move a token from the starting square.
<br>
        <br>
Penalties:

1. Sending Token Back: Captured tokens return to the starting square.
2. Missing Turn: A player who rolls a number that cannot be played misses their turn.
<br>
        <br>
Variations:

1. Team Play: Players can form teams.
2. Time Limit: Set a time limit for each player's turn.
3. Wild Dice: Introduce special dice with unique rules.
<br>
        <br>
Common Terms:

1. Token: Game piece.
2. Square: Space on the board.
3. Home: Safety zone.
<br>
        <br>
Tips and Strategies:

1. Block Opponents: Place tokens strategically.
2. Create Pathways: Move tokens to create pathways.
3. Focus on One Token: Prioritize moving one token home.
<br>
        <br>
Now you know the rules! Gather friends and family, and enjoy playing Ludo.
