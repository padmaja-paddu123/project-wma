          <P>
            <h1>RULES </h1>
            <P> Gameplay Basics
               The ball must be moved using any body part except hands and arms, except for the goalkeeper within their designated area ¹ ². Players can use their feet, chest, or head to control and move the ball.
               <br>
   
               <br>
               Scoring
               A goal is scored when the ball completely crosses the goal line between the goalposts and under the crossbar ¹. The team with the most goals at the end of the 90 minutes wins.

               <br>
               1.Common Rules
               Some key rules to keep in mind:
               
               - Offside: A player is offside if they're closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last opponent when the ball is played forward ¹ ².
               - Fouls: Physical contact or unsportsmanlike behavior can result in a free kick or penalty kick for the opposing team ¹ ².
               - Free Kicks: Awarded after a foul, allowing the opposing team to kick the ball from where the foul occurred ¹.
               - Penalty Kicks: Awarded after a serious foul within the goalkeeper's area, allowing a shot on goal ¹.
               - Goalkeepers: Can use hands within their designated area, but must follow specific rules ¹ ².
               <br>  2.Gameplay Stoppage

               - Ball out of bounds: When the ball crosses the touchline or goal line ¹.
               - Fouls: When a player commits a foul, resulting in a free kick or penalty kick ¹ ².
               - Injuries: When a player is injured, and the referee stops play ¹.
               <BR>
                3.Restarts
                  The game can be restarted with:
               
               - Kick-offs: Starting or restarting play from the center spot ¹.
               - Throw-ins: When the ball goes out of bounds over the touchline ¹.
               - Goal kicks: When the ball goes out of bounds over the goal line and was last touched by an opponent ¹.
               - Corner kicks: When the ball goes out of bounds over the goal line and was last touched by the defending team ¹.
