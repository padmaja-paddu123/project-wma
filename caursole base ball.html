            Here's a comprehensive overview of the rules of baseball:

            Gameplay Basics
            
            1. Objective: Score more runs than the opposing team by hitting a ball with a bat and running around the four bases.
            2. Game duration: 9 innings, with each team getting a chance to bat and field.
            3. Teams: Two teams, each with 9 players.

        <br>
            Basic Rules
            
            1. Innings: Each team plays offense (bats) and defense (fields) in each inning.
            2. At-bats: Each player gets a chance to hit the ball.
            3. Strikes: Three strikes result in an out.
            4. Balls: Four balls outside the strike zone result in a walk.
            5. Hits: Ball hit into play, allowing runner to reach base.
            6. Runs: Scored when a runner reaches home plate.

            Common Rules
            
            1. Outs: Three outs end the inning.
                - Strikeout (swinging or called)
                - Flyout (ball caught in air)
                - Groundout (ball fielded, runner out)
                - Tag out (runner touched with ball)
                - Force out (runner forced to advance)
            2. Base Running:
                - Runners can advance on hits or errors.
                - Runners must touch each base.
                - Runners can be tagged or forced out.
            3. Fielding:
                - Fielders must catch or field the ball.
                - Fielders can throw to bases to record outs.
            4. Pitching:
                - Pitchers throw from the pitcher's mound.
                - Pitchers must follow specific rules (e.g., stepping off the rubber).
