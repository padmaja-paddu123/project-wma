          <P> 
            Hockey is an exciting sport with a rich history, and understanding its rules can enhance your enjoyment of the game. The objective of hockey is simple: score more goals than the opposing team by using a stick to drive the ball or puck into the opponent's goal ¹ ².

    - The game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 15 minutes, with a two-minute break after the first and third quarters and a 15-minute halftime break ¹.
    - Players use sticks to pass, dribble, and shoot the ball, and goals can only be scored from inside the striking circle ¹.
